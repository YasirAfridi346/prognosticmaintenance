In the current era, where global warming and climate change are considered to be one of the largest threats to mankind, the focus has been shifted towards renewable sources of energy for the generation of electricity rather than the use of fossil fuels. Among these, Hydro power has always been the leading source of energy generation. However, over the past few decades, sources like wind power and solar power have also gained much more importance. The extensive research in the area has led to the development of technological advanced and highly complex power generation machines. On one hand, where this development has increased the efficiency and performance of the equipment, consequently it has also generated the need for developing state of the art operation and maintenance systems. Since, the unaccounted faults and preventive maintenance that lead to equipment and plant downtime are now unaffordable. Hence, the need for a paradigm shift from the conventional reactive approaches of fault rectification towards the proactive approaches of fault identification is being felt. This leads to the need of developing an efficient and robust prognostic maintenance system that can identify the faults ahead of time. Hence, our prognostic maintenance system along with predicting the bearing faults not only aims at reducing the plant downtimes but also decreases the associated maintenance cost.
